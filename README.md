## A training timetable

This code is used to run the site available at [`renshuu.paazmaya.fi`](http://renshuu.paazmaya.fi),
which offers an easy way to build a training timetable within the
Japanese martial arts.

The purpose of this project is to create a site that enables its users
to find and create martial art training sessions at different locations,
and then combine these as a training schedule. It will try to calculate
the time needed to travel in between each training location and finally
allow to print a list of them.

Initially I started to build this in the end of the Summer 2010, once I
had returned from my first training adventure in Japan that took for one
month.

Despite the fact that this project is incomplete, I have done already
another similar trip, for a bit over two months in the Summer 2011.

## Technical logic

- User logs in via OAuth provider, via Auth0
- User searches for available trainings of the selected martial arts in the view area of the map
- User can add new training location with training time table to the map
- User can choose a training session to be added in users list of trainings
- Once user has more than one training session in the list, distance calculation occurs
- User can use export settings to change the static map layout which will be for each location in the printable output

## TODO

- Markup _should_ be completely valid HTML5 and CSS3 for styling.
- SQL table creation script is only compatible with MySQL...
- Compare Nokia Maps (http://api.maps.nokia.com/) with Google Maps. Is it worth the effort to make them switchable? http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/Converting_Google_Maps_for_JavaScript_to_HERE_Maps
